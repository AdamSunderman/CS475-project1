	Project 1 - BÃ©zier Surfaces Area

	*Requirements
		1. Using OpenMP, compute the total volume betwen the two surfaces. 
		
		2. Use a variety of number of subdivisions (NUMNODES). Pick at least 8 different ones.
		
		3. Use a variety of number of threads (NUMT). You must use at least 1, 2, and 4. 
		
		4. Record the data in units of something that gets larger as speed increases. Joe Parallel 
	   	   used "MegaHeights Computed Per Second", but you can use anything that makes sense. 
		
		5. From the speed-up that you are seeing, use the "Inverse Amdahl's Law" to determine the 
	   	   Parallel Fraction for this application. 
    	
    	6. From the Parallel Fraction, determine what maximum speed-up you could ever get, even 
       	   with a million cores. 
 
    **Your commentary write-up (turned in as a PDF file) should include: 
		1. Tell what machine you ran this on.
		
		2. What do you think the actual volume is?
		
		3. Show the performances you achieved in tables and graphs as a function of NUMNODES 
		   and NUMT.
		
		4. What patterns are you seeing in the speeds?
		
		5. Why do you think it is behaving this way?
		
		6. What is the Parallel Fraction for this application, using the Inverse Amdahl 
		   equation?
		
		7. Given that Parallel Fraction, what is the maximum speed-up you could ever get?
